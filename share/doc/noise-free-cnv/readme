noise-free-cnv is a program for analyzing and manipulating DNA microarray data.

CNV calling software may produce false-positive calls due to imperfect
source material. Direct inspection of the microarray data with the
noise-free-cnv software helps to estimate the quality of the data and
to identify artificial calls.

With noise-free-cnv it is possible to visualize individual datasets, to
compare different datasets and to perform simple transformations. The
visualization and the suppression of genomic waves, the comparison of
two datasets by subtraction and the simultaneous inspection of LRR and
BAF values are amongst the most frequent applications of this software.

This program is able to read and write files suitable for PennCNV or raw
files containing measured values of any kind.
